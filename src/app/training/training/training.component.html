            1. Ask yourself why do you want to write a diary?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="p">The very first thing you have to find an answer to when you are thinking about
          how to start a diary is of course why you want to have a diary.
          Is it to keep track of things that have happened, or is it to plan ahead?
          Will you cover a specific topic in your diary, or will it be all-encompassing?

          Perhaps you feel a need to let your creativity loose,
          and want to set aside some time for it regularly? A diary does not
          have to be a notebook with written text in it, it might just as well
          contain pictures, drawings or sketches.</p>

        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="p">Once you have settled on a topic in your how to start
          a diary project, dedicate the first page to the topic. State what
          it is, why you chose it and what you intend to accomplish with the
          diary. If the topic is connected to any goals, note them down as well.
          If you go for an index, this is the place for it.</p>

            4. How often and for how long?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="p">Now we are at the finer details on how to start a diary, such as deciding on the frequency of
          updating, and for
          how long you intend to keep your diary.
          Some topics have obvious choices, for example, a pregnancy diary, where there is a natural start and stop
          date.
          The update frequency could be chosen a bit more freely, even if there are some expected choices there as
          well.

          For other topics though, such as a race diary, for example, the time period covered might be more difficult
          to
          set (a year? the length of the notebook? until the next Olympic games?) than the frequency (after each
          race).

          When you are thinking about how to start a diary, also consider how much time you have to spend on it. Make
          a
          realistic estimate on the update frequency based on how much time you have or intend to make available for
          it.
